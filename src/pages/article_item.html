        <p class="lead">Held on Thursday the 15th October, this was the second Te Awe / Pasifika joint function to be run. Like the first event, this was just as successful and enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>The guest speaker was Adrian Orr, Chief Executive Officer for the New Zealand Super Fund. He was not what a lot of people had expected with his very down to earth and humorous approach to what was an entertaining and very informative presentation. Adrian was joined by Matt Whineray, Chief Investment Officer for the New Zealand Super Fund. Together they highlighted what they do or rather, how they do it.</p>
        <p>The event was focussed toward start-up businesses but a lot of that relates to older businesses too. All business can benefit from the right help and obtaining the best information possible.</p>
        <p><strong>The event offered advice, help and business insights with:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Business Plans</li>
          <li>Insurance</li>
          <li>Banking advice from ANZ</li>
          <li>Tax advice from IRD</li>
          <li>Marketing</li>
          <li>Website - Build and requirements</li>
          <li>Brand Specialists. Logo development. Brand design and development.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There were also three other speakers on the night. All start-up businesses or businesses that were still relatively young.</p>
        <p>Tyrone McAuley - Co-Founder and Co-Owner at PikPok. PikPok is a mobile game development studio and publisher based here in Wellington.</p>
        <p>Shannon Paku – Ex Wellington, Hurricane, Auckland and Manawatu rugby player now owns a contracting truck business that carries for Goodman Fielder Dairy &amp; Meats. New Zealand’s largest food service company.</p>
        <p>The final person to share their start-up story was Saimon Lomalom. Simon is at the beginning of setting up a new water sports business in Wellington with the vision of expansion into Queenstown and then Australia. Simon was the Financial Controller at OMV up until recently.</p>
        <p>All three speakers shared the same stories of the things in business that can go wrong and the challenges that small to medium business can face. This highlighted one thing – that no matter what that business does – the challenges are always the exactly the same.</p>
        <p> The night finished with some great networking and the $1,000 Free Advertising prize going to Pat Kelly from Kelly Hygiene.</p>
